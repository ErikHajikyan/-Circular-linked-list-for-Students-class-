 Circular linked list: Implement a Circular Linked List to store collection of Student      objects. Date=(Name, ID, GPA)(insert, remove, reverse)

The code is made by using the circular linked list. Each element has a NEXT, and a PREVIOUS. The last element has an access to the first one(the next of the last element is HEAD).At first the user should set the first student which will be the HEAD(using the setHEad method). The Student class has objects NAME ID GPA. The code allaws us to insert a new studnet AtTheBeginning of the list and appand in the list(from end). User can find a student in a list by using FIND method. User can remove a student by using DELETE method.The method REVERSE allaws the user to reverse the list of Students.
All methods are used in main() and the half of them are commented with #, for the input to be more readable. The user can remove # sign and the method will work
